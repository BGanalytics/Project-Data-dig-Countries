# Project-Data-dig-Countries
Exploring population of countries, forecasting population trends, making lists of countries with certain criteria

Challenge: We have a table of all countires including their poplution, population density, immigration rate, fertility rate, median age. 
Real data from 2020. Answer the following questions using SQL:  

* What are the most and least populated countires in this table? 
* Which country has the highest life expectancy?
* What is the average life expectancy in the world?
* Which country has the largest number of immigrants?
* Where does Canada stand in the number of immigrants?
* Create a list of countires that are densly populated.
*  Create a list of countires that are lightly populated.
*  Forecast the population trend of the most and least populated countries.
*  List the countries yoyu would like to live in. (lightly populated or high life expectancy)


My approach: Using MIN, MAX, AVG to aggreagte data and using ORDER BY to create lists in ascending/decending order, and using HAVING when handling vategories. 
 Applying CASE to categorise countries based on their life expectancy: Very high, high, average, below average, low. 
 Using AND/OR to select countries that meet a certain criteria.
